Explaining the criteria for choosing statistical techniques based on variable types and research questions, distinguishing between descriptive and inferential statistics. The report highlights the impact of violating statistical assumptions and the importance of selecting appropriate tests, such as the chi-square test for nominal variables, t-tests for continuous data, and ANOVA for multiple groups.

        "The time series data analysis segment applies visual inspection, autocorrelation functions, and statistical tests (KPSS and ADF) to evaluate the constancy of means over time for wind speed and Microsoft stock trading volume. The findings reveal that while wind speed showed a constant mean, the stock volume results were mixed, emphasizing the need for multiple testing methods. The final section compares ARIMA models for US unemployment rate data, analyzing different model fits and autocorrelation. The analysis illustrates the effectiveness of ARIMA models in capturing time series patterns, with varying degrees of model performance and fit statistics across different configurations.\n",

        "The Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), the Schwarz Criterion (Bayesian Information Criterion, BIC), and the Hannan-Quinn Information Criterion (HQIC) are metrics used to evaluate the goodness of fit of statistical models.\n",
        "\n",
        "-   **Akaike Information Criterion (AIC):** AIC assesses the relative fit of a model while penalizing for the number of parameters. It is useful for comparing models where smaller values indicate a better fit.\n",

        "\n",
        "-   **Hannan-Quinn Information Criterion (HQIC):** HQIC is another relative fit metric that falls between AIC and BIC in terms of penalizing complexity. It also provides a measure of model fit with a focus on balancing fit and simplicity.\n",
        "\n",
        "Both BIC and HQIC are more conservative compared to AIC as they impose a higher penalty for the inclusion of additional variables. Therefore, smaller values of these metrics indicate a better fit of the model to the data.\n",

        "\n",
        "Among the metrics discussed, **BIC** and **Hannan-Quinn** are the most conservative in penalizing models for additional parameters. They impose a greater penalty for model complexity, making them more stringent criteria for evaluating model fit. As a result, these metrics are typically used when a more parsimonious model is preferred.\n",
