# Market Segmentation Analysis Report: Dr Pepper

#### **Introduction**

This report presents a comprehensive market segmentation analysis aimed at identifying consumer segments that align with Dr Pepper's marketing strategies. By leveraging variables related to consumer behavior, preferences, and attitudes, actionable insights have been extracted to inform targeted marketing efforts.

The objective of this analysis is to uncover distinct consumer segments by analyzing key drivers and descriptors derived from the NCS data dictionary. These insights aim to guide targeted marketing strategies, enhance customer engagement, and increase market share for Dr Pepper.

Data Sources: Data were obtained from a personal survey booklet, and the segmentation analysis was conducted using SAS software.

#### **Methodology**

In this section, I will outline the key analytical steps taken to perform the segmentation analysis.

The **Target variable** for segmentation is Dr Pepper, representing consumer preferences for the brand.

The **Driver Variables** were utilized to effectively segment the market, four key driver variables were selected, representing consumer behaviors that are likely to influence their choices regarding beverages:

```         
   drink_between_meals: Reflects whether the consumer often drinks between meals.

   like_to_try_new_drinks: Captures curiosity and willingness to try new beverages.

   when_on_tv_go_online_get_more: Measures how likely the consumer is to go online after seeing an ad on TV.

   buy_online_or_in_store: Indicates whether the consumer prefers to shop online or in-store.
```

For the **Abstract Constructor Factor Variables:** I selected two key factors that were derived from multiple related variables using Principal Component Analysis (PCA):

```         
Indulgence Behavior and Attitude: How likely is the consumer indulging in various indulgent behaviors or habits?

     DRINKING_GET_DRUNK: "The point of drinking is to get drunk."

     OFTEN_DRINK_ALCOHOL: "Often drink alcoholic beverages at restaurants."

     TRY_NEW_FOOD_PRDCT: "I'm usually first to try new food products."

     FEEL_GUILTY_SWEETS: "I feel guilty when I eat sweets."

Environmental Behavior and Attitude: How important does the consumer believe in taking responsibility for the environment?

     PEOPLE_NEED_TO_RECYCLE: "People have a duty to recycle."

     MAKE_EFFORT_TO_RECYCLE: "I make an effort to recycle."

     PEOPLE_RESPONS_TO_RECYCLD_PRDCTS: "People have a responsibility to use recycled products."

     PERSONAL_ENVRNMNT_RESPONSIBLE: "Personal obligation and environmental responsibility."
```

Next, the **Descriptor Variables:** provide additional insights into consumer characteristics:

```         
   Competitive Preferences:

      dr_pepper: "I prefer Dr Pepper."

      Coca_Cola: "I prefer Coca-Cola."

      Sprite: "I prefer Sprite."

   Demographic Factors:

      Gender: Male, Female

      Region: Northeast, Midwest, South, West

      Age Groups**: 18-24, 25-49, 50+

   Media Preferences**:

      Spotify**: "Spotify was used during the last 7 days."

      YouTube**: "YouTube was used during the last 7 days."
 
      ESPN**: "ESPN was viewed during the last 7 days."
```

#### Factor Analysis

To reduce dimensionality and identify underlying factors, PCA was conducted. Two key factors were derived, reflecting consumer behaviors and attitudes.

**Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**

![](PCA1.png){width="374"}

The PCA was utilized to extract abstract constructs from multiple variables. The Kaiser Criterion was applied to retain factors with eigenvalues greater than or equal to 1. The analysis resulted in two factors accounting for 52.34% of the total variance (Factor 1: 35.79%, Factor 2: 16.55%).

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

To further refine our factor selection, we examined the **scree plot** and applied the **elbow criterion**. By focusing on the point where the curve begins to flatten, we confirmed the decision to retain two factors. This approach ensures that we capture the most meaningful patterns in the data without overcomplicating the model.

After identifying the two key factors through PCA, the **Rotated Factor Pattern** was applied to enhance interpretability. Interestingly, the rotation revealed that **Factor 1**, initially labeled as reflecting **Indulgent Behaviors**, actually exhibited stronger correlations with variables related to **Environmental Responsibility**. Conversely, **Factor 2**, originally linked to **Environmental Responsibility**, displayed significant associations with **Indulgent Behaviors**. This shift in factor interpretation underscores the nuanced interplay between consumer behaviors and attitudes, paving the way for a deeper exploration of these patterns.

Building on the insights from factor analysis, **K-Means Clustering** was employed to further segment the consumer groups. The number of clusters was evaluated using the **CCC Plot** and **Pseudo F Plot**, which suggested viable cluster counts of 3, 5, and 9. Through detailed analysis of cluster means and interpretability, a three-cluster solution emerged as the most parsimonious and insightful segmentation.

| Number of Clusters | R square | CCC    | Pseudo F |
|--------------------|----------|--------|----------|
| 3                  | 0.27176  | 39.855 | 5622.32  |
| 4                  | 0.36802  | 9.71   | 5076.37  |
| 5                  | 0.42914  | 21.246 | 5104.69  |
| 6                  | 0.46407  | 11.616 | 4523.63  |
| 7                  | 0.49418  | 2.269  | 4118.01  |
| 8                  | 0.51624  | 34.21  | 4258.66  |
| 9                  | 0.53490  | 53.675 | 4263.33  |

**CCC Plot:** The CCC plot reveals the first local maximum at k=3, with subsequent notable peaks at k=5 and k=9. These observations suggest that 3, 5, and 9 could be viable cluster counts.

![](CCC.png)

The **Pseudo F plot** corroborates the findings from the CCC plot, showing the highest value at **k=3**, with a secondary peak at **k=5**. Beyond **k=5**, the values begin to decline, reinforcing the idea that both 3 and 5 clusters are reasonable solutions.

![](pseudo.png)

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

However, determining the best solution requires deeper analysis. To that end, we proceed by examining the **Cluster Means** to understand the variation within clusters and assess the interpretability of each model.

After reviewing the **Cluster Means** for both 3 and 5 clusters, clear differences emerge. **Cluster 3** exhibits significant variation across most variables, indicating that a simpler 3-cluster model may offer better interpretability. In contrast, while **Cluster 5** also shows variation, it introduces additional complexity, which may hinder the clarity of the solution. Based on these observations, a 3-cluster solution appears to be more practical and interpretable.

![](clustermean.png)

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

To ensure that this solution is robust, we conduct a **Gap Analysis** to confirm the cluster validity and further evaluate the chosen model.

A **Gap Analysis** was conducted to validate the cluster solutions. While the **First Peak** and **Global Peak** initially suggested a 2-cluster solution, the **K-Means clustering** with 3 clusters was favored for its clarity and ease of interpretation.

![](GAP.png)

By examining the **Gap Analysis cluster means**, we found that the clusters are well-defined, with clear distinctions between them. This supports the decision to proceed with the 3-cluster solution.

![](gap%20mean.png){width="451"}

Examining the GAP Analysis cluster means further supports the notion that the clusters are well-defined, demonstrating adequate discrimination between them.

Moreover, a comparison between the K-means and HPCLUS approaches provides additional insights into the strengths of each method. With this confirmation, we can now delve into the detailed findings and descriptions of each cluster, which will provide a clearer understanding of the consumer segments identified through the analysis.

**Findings and Cluster Descriptions**

![](descriptor.png)

#### 

**Cluster 1 (Seasonal Customers):** This cluster is characterized by older individuals, predominantly women, who display a lower preference for beverages compared to other clusters. They tend to be more conservative in trying new drinks and show moderate engagement in online shopping.

**Cluster 2 (Media Enthusiasts):** Members of this cluster are inclined to consume beverages between meals and demonstrate a strong interest in trying new drinks. They are highly responsive to media prompts and exhibit the highest usage of media platforms such as YouTube and Spotify. The demographic distribution is more balanced in terms of age and gender, and this group shows a higher preference for beverages.

**Cluster 3 (Beverage Aficionados):** Individuals in this cluster have the highest propensity for drinking between meals and the greatest enthusiasm for trying new beverages. They are particularly responsive to media advertisements and exhibit a preference for online shopping over in-store purchases. This cluster also shows the highest preference for beverages and ranks second in terms of media engagement.

#### Recommendations

My recommendation is for Dr Pepper to direct their marketing efforts towards Clusters 2 and 3.

-   **Cluster 2** comprises individuals who exhibit a positive attitude towards trying new drinks and demonstrate high online activity, including making purchases online.

-   **Cluster 3** consists of individuals who are environmentally conscious, enthusiastic about trying new beverages, and favor online shopping. They also show a strong preference for drinks.

Targeting these two clusters would allow Dr Pepper to effectively leverage its advertising and marketing strategies, potentially acquiring new customers, particularly in the southern region of the country.

#### **Conclusion**

This market segmentation analysis offers valuable insights for Dr Pepper to refine its marketing strategies by targeting distinct consumer segments. Concentrating on Clusters 2 and 3 enables Dr Pepper to engage with segments that demonstrate a higher propensity for digital media consumption and a willingness to experiment with new beverages. This strategic focus is expected to enhance market presence and foster stronger customer retention.
